# Netflix Clone

A responsive front-end clone of the Netflix streaming platform built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
This project demonstrates the ability to recreate a real-world production UI with clean structure, smooth interactions, and responsive design, making it suitable for portfolio, resume, and internship applications.

## Project Overview

The Netflix Clone replicates the visual design and core interaction patterns of the official Netflix web interface.  
It focuses on frontend fundamentals such as layout structuring, component-based styling, DOM manipulation, and user interaction handling without using any external frameworks or backend services.

The project is fully client-side and emphasizes writing clean, readable, and maintainable code while closely matching an industry-grade UI.

## Key Features

- Netflix-style fixed navigation bar with menu items and action icons  
- Large hero banner highlighting featured content with Play and More Info actions  
- Horizontally scrollable rows for movies and series

- **Font Awesome**  
  Used to implement scalable vector icons in the navigation bar and footer.
