All screenshots are taken directly from the working project and should be placed inside the `screenshots` folder at the root of the repository.

## Description

The Netflix Clone replicates the visual appearance and basic interaction patterns of the official Netflix web interface.  
It includes a fixed top navigation bar, a featured hero banner highlighting selected content, horizontally scrollable rows for movies and series, hover-based card animations, and a video modal that plays a trailer when the Play button is clicked.

This project was created to strengthen frontend development skills and gain hands-on experience with real-world UI structures.  
It is a fully client-side project with no backend dependency and does not use any external frameworks.


## Technologies Used

1. HTML5 is used to structure the web pages and define the layout of UI components.
2. CSS3 is used for styling, layout design, animations, transitions, and responsive behavior.
3. JavaScript (Vanilla JS) is used to handle user interactions such as button clicks, modal open and close behavior, keyboard events, and video playback control.
4. Font Awesome is used for icons in the navigation bar and footer.

## Features

1. Fixed Netflix-style navigation bar with menu items and icons
2. Large hero banner showcasing featured content with Play and More Info buttons
3. Horizontally scrollable movie and series rows
4. Hover effects on movie cards for improved user experience
5. Video modal that plays a trailer and supports keyboard-based closing
6. Responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes
7. Clean and organized folder structure for assets and screenshots

## Usage

This project can be used as a frontend portfolio project, a practice project for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, a UI reference for streaming platform designs, or a base template for future enhancements such as backend integration or framework migration.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to run the project locally.

## Prerequisites

Any modern web browser such as Chrome, Edge, or Firefox  
Windows, macOS, or Linux operating system  
A code editor such as Visual Studio Code (recommended)

## Installation

* All project screenshots are stored inside `screenshots/`

No additional setup or configuration is required.

## Executing the Program

Open the `index.html` file directly in any modern web browser.
Alternatively, you can use Live Server in VS Code for a better development experience.

No terminal command is required to run the project.

## Help and Common Issues

Images not loading usually indicate incorrect relative paths inside the assets folders.
Video not playing may occur if the video file is missing or not in MP4 format.
Icons not appearing usually indicate a missing internet connection required for the Font Awesome CDN.
If the modal does not close, use the close button or press the Escape key.
